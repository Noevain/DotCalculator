## DoT Calculator

Dalamud plugin that tries it's best to show you how much damage your active DoTs have dealt so far.

Pretty much everything under MathStuff is borrowed from [ffxiv-characterstatus-refined](https://github.com/Kouzukii/ffxiv-characterstatus-refined) huge thanks
, I simply trimmed everything I didn't need.

Due to DoT math in xiv being insane, I am basically calculating DoT ticks as if they were a regular hit.This is usually close enough
Unfortunately due to the way DoT works it's impossible to be accurate, ACT/FFlogs will have more precision due to 
being able to estimate everyone's else DoT damage but this plugin purpose is to just give you a rough estimate

I might come back to it mainly to make visual adjustments, make DoTs more engaging.
